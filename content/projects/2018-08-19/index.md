# Description

The Rock Creek Park, a District Columbia based land trust and watershed restoration non-profit, is looking for volunteers to help with tree maintenance. Tree maintenance involves removing invasive plants, checking planted trees to see if the shelter needs to be removed and removing if necessary, digging out the planting tube, and making sure the plant is upright.

The planted trees protect the Loch Raven Reservoir, District of Columbia's drinking water. Trees are important. They emit oxygen, sequester carbon dioxide, absorb pollutants, prevent erosion and storm water runoff and provide animal habitat.

Community service learning hours available.

What to bring: Wear long pants, long sleeved shirt and closed-toed shoes (boots are best). Bring leather gloves if you have them. Bring a filled water bottle.

Directions:From Towson, head north on Dulaney Valley Road and cross the bridge over the reservoir. At intersection with Jarrettsville Pike (146), continue on Dulaney Valley Road and eventually turn left to stay on Dulaney Valley Road at the intersection at the old Peerce's Restaurant. Follow a short distance to where overhead powerlines cross. Turn left at the white gazebo and park. Do NOT block the gate.
