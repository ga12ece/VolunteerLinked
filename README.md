## Inspiration
* We want to build a professional volunteer network. With our website, people can show the others how excellent they are as a volunteer.       
* Like Tinder, we hope passionate volunteers who want to find people like themselves can have a more organized place to make friends, and a comfortable place to share voluntary stories.       
* We also want to make it easier for charities to find proper volunteers.
* We hope we can inspire more people to join voluntary work.

## What it does
 * It gathers all kinds of events from all over the country. You don't have to go to different organizations' websites to check the coming events.
 * You can meet new friends here and share your passion about how to make the world better.
 * As an event publisher, you can invite efficient, talkative or any other kind of people you wish to work with.
 * Offering coupons, gift cards and other rewards, which are sponsored, to volunteers will encourage more people doing good.

## How I built it
* The front end is built on Gatsby and will be deployed by AWS.
* The ChatBot is built with Microsoft Bot Builder and LUIS.AI for NLU
* The data analysis is built with IBM Watson Studio - SPSS
